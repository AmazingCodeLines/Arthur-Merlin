    <p>It is said that King Arthur, the once and future king, was born in a time of chaos and uncertainty. England was divided among feuding lords, and the people yearned for a true leader who could unite the land. Arthurâ€™s birth was veiled in mystery. Some say he was the secret son of King Uther Pendragon, taken away at birth and raised in secret to protect him from those who would do him harm. Others claim the hand of fate itself placed Arthur in the care of a wise old wizard named Merlin, who guided him from a young age toward his destiny.</p>
